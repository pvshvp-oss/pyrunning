- [ ] Commit and push all changes through git, for example `git commit -m "Some message" && git push`

- [ ] Create and push a tag, for example `git tag -s -a v0.0.17 -m "This is version 0.0.17" && git push origin v0.0.17`
- [ ] If there was a mistake and if you want to yank the release, run something like `git tag -d v0.0.17 && git push --delete origin v0.0.17`. Then the errors can be fixed and the previous step can be repeated to create a new tag.
